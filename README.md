# Coronary Heart Disease

![]()

### Why Coronary Heart Disease?
About 1 in every 4Â deaths each year are caused by heart disease. Coronary Heart Disease is the most common type of heart disease, causing over half the heart disease deaths in 2017.
Looking for comorbid factors and being able to predict heart disease in patients could help doctors prevent its occurrence and could lower these statistics. 

Using a dataset containing 4,000 records from Framingham, Massachusetts, we examined common factors used to predict heart disease to create a machine learning model that would predict the likeliness of developing Coronary Heart Disease in the next 10 years.

We used the following tools:
 Python:
  - SciKit Learn
  - joblib
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Numpy
